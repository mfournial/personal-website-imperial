        <p>The Imperial Department of Computing probably records your IP along with the HTTP <em>Referer</em> & <em>User-Agent</em> and a bunch of other things you are sending when requesting this page. I don't set any cookie here, run advertisement or have any kind of <em>analytics</em> running so no annoying pop-up banner on this website! <a href="http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> is required though to be able to download the compiled notes since to get you to download the latest version of the notes, the URL needs to be determined through GitHub's API (for the maths notes in particular).</p>
        <p>You can find the code for this site in a <a href="https://github.com/mfournial/personal-website-imperial">GitHub repo</a> (<em>It may still be private though at this time, sorry :s</em>) if you like looking at HTML.</p>
