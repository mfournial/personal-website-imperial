> Personal ~mmf115 website you can [find here](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mmf115/)

:warning: **This is still a WIP** :warning:

## Build Setup

### Requirements

* Node 10. Started with `nvm use 10.15.1` originally.
* Install dependencies
``` bash
npm install
```

### Usage

The site is configured to be deployed on DoC's servers which serves static content.
[Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) is built on top of VueJS to handle both static deployments and a classic hot reload dev server to use as follows:

```bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
